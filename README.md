The interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to showcase key insights from a dataset sourced from Kaggle. 

The dashboard allows users to filter by driver nationality, active driver status, and championship-winning drivers. Key metrics include total points acquired by each driver, comparisons of total pole positions vs. total wins, and a breakdown of pole positions vs. race wins. 

Additionally, the dashboard displays statistics such as total podium finishes and average win rate, providing a comprehensive view of the drivers' performance.
